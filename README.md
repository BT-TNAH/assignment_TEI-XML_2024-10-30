  This project focuses on **transcribing and editing three letters written within the French royal court at the end of the 14th century**. 
  
  These letters, exchanged between **the King of France and members of his chancellery**, are of particular interest to my research on **medieval diplomacy**. 
  
  Specifically, they pertain to **negotiations conducted between the French and Hungarian courts** from 1374 to 1378 regarding a proposed marriage between Catherine, the daughter of the King of Hungary, and Louis, the son of the King of France. 
  
  The documents provide valuable insights into the preparations for **the signing of a marriage treaty**, as well as the compensation of an envoy sent to the Kingdom of Hungary.







  **Using XML** as the primary method for structuring and analyzing the data offers significant advantages for the study of these historical documents. 
  
  XML provides a flexible and precise framework for encoding critical textual details, such as the names of senders and addressees, production and conservation locations, and the dates associated with the letters. 

  This structured approach will facilitate **efficient searching, detailed cross-referencing, and comparative analysis of the documents**, enabling a reconstruction of the chronology and the progression of the negotiations. 

  Additionally, by adopting XML encoding, the project aims to ensure interoperability with other digital humanities initiatives, fostering broader collaboration opportunities and enriching the accessibility and analytical value of the study.
